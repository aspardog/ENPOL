# ENPOL Project


## Objective

This project aims to analyze the Criminal Justice System (SJPA, for its acronym in Spanish) in Mexico using data from the Encuesta Nacional de Población Privada de Libertad (ENPOL) recolected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI). The ENPOL survey provides valuable insights into the experiences and perspectives of individuals within the Mexican SJPA, including their interactions with law enforcement, the judicial process, and prison conditions. The present repository contains the R code the World Justice Project used to produce the ENPOL project's data inputs. 

## Files description

The present repository is structured based in the following filing system:

<img width="400" alt="FILE" src="https://github.com/aspardog/ENPOL/assets/85714147/3cb8f7f4-4e77-4e0f-bb05-1141138535ac">

Under this system you will find three main structures:

0. Directorio 

1. Data Analysis Process 

  1.1 Data_cleaning
  1.2 Descriptives
  1.3 Exploration
  1.4 Hypothesis
  1.5 Data_check
  1.6 Visualization 
  
2. Data Generation Process

  2.1 Input
  2.2 Code
  2.3 Output

The Directory file provides an overview of the data generated by the codes, and the theoretical variables.

The Data Analysis Process files comprehensively goes through all the stages of the data workflow

Within the Data Generation files it is shown only the Code output, which it contains the R commands data processed the data.
