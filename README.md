# ENPOL Project


## Objective

This project aims to analyze the Criminal Justice System (SJPA, for its acronym in Spanish) in Mexico using data from the Encuesta Nacional de Población Privada de Libertad (ENPOL) recolected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI). The ENPOL survey provides valuable insights into the experiences and perspectives of individuals within the Mexican SJPA, including their interactions with law enforcement, the judicial process, and prison conditions. The present repository contains the R code the World Justice Project used to produce the ENPOL project's data inputs. 

## Files description

The present repository is structured based on the following filing system:

<img width="1500" alt="FILE" src="https://github.com/aspardog/ENPOL/assets/85714147/3cb8f7f4-4e77-4e0f-bb05-1141138535ac">

Under this system, you will find three main structures:

- Directorio 

- Data Analysis Process 
  - Data_cleaning
  - Descriptives
  - Exploration
  - Hypothesis
  - Data_check
  - Visualization 
  
- Data Generation Process
  - Input
  - Code
  - Output

The Directory file provides an overview of the data generated by the codes and the theoretical variables.

The Data Analysis Process files comprehensively go through all the stages of the data workflow.

The Data Generation files show only the Code output, which contains the R commands data processed the data.

## Workflow

Some of the Codes has the following structure:

1. Upper level: A single file controls all the program and it is the RunMe.R script. This is a "single-call" file and it is designed to just be called along with a single argument that contains the abbreviated name of the country group that we would like to generate the figure for. Once that it is called, the script will start generating the outputs of the activated functions, such as in hypothesis.

2. Defining Functions: The RunMe file will call several defining functions. Depending on the stage of the data process, .
